# Loan-Approval-Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval using machine learning models based on applicant features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

## Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported.
2. **Load Data**: The dataset is loaded and initial exploration is conducted.
3. **Identify Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are detected and visualized.
4. **Encode Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are converted to numerical values.
5. **Visualize Correlations**: Correlations between features are visualized using a heatmap.
6. **Handle Missing Values**: Missing values are imputed with column means.
7. **Split Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
8. **Train and Evaluate Models**: Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated for accuracy.

## Dataset

- **File**: `LoanApprovalPrediction.csv`
- **Description**: Contains loan application data with features and loan status.
